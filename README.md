NowCast

NowCast predicts water quality conditions at select swimming areas. NowCast estimates conditions similar to a weather forecast, by merging environment and climate data with variables measured at a swimming area by 8 AM each morning and entering them into a computer program. The program provides a probability from 1 to 100 as to whether or not the swimming area has exceeded the bathing-water standard of 235 colony forming units of E. coli.
