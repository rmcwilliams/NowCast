								<!--a href="nowcast_glossary.asp#Escherichia coli"-->E. coli
								<!--/a-->
							</i>, found in sewage and other animal wastes. But because results of

											<p>The State of Ohio uses standards for
												<i>E. coli</i> to assess whether the water quality is acceptable for swimming or other recreational activities.
												<i>E. coli</i> is a bacterium that is not usually disease causing but is found in the gastrointestinal tract of
												healthy warm-blooded animals, including humans, and their feces. Its presence is an indicator that disease-causing
												organisms are also likely to be present.</p>
											<p>For Lake Erie swimming areas, if the level of
												<i>E. coli</i> goes over the single-sample
												<!--a href="nowcast_glossary.asp#Bathing waters"-->bathing-water standard
												<!--/a-->of 235 most-probable number per 100 milliliters (MPN/100 mL), the manager at the swimming area will issue a water-quality
												ADVISORY. managers at swimming areas may also use the units of 235 colony-forming units per 100 milliliters (CFU/100
												mL), depending on the analytical method used to quantify
												<i>E. coli</i>. For the stretch of the Cuyahoga River that includes the nowcast site at Jaite, the river has been
												designated as primary-contact recreation, and the single-sample
												<!--a href="nowcast_glossary.asp#Primary-contact waters"-->primary-contact standard
												<!--/a-->is 298 MPN/100 mL or CFU/100 mL. A milliliter is a unit of volume in the metric system; 100 milliliters is equivalent
												to just under ½ cup.

													What is commonly done to monitor recreational water quality is to collect a water sample from the swimming area or stream,
													transport the sample to a laboratory, and determine numbers of
													<i>E. coli</i> in the sample. The problem is that it takes at least 18 hours to grow
													<i>E. coli</i> in the laboratory. Unfortunately, by the time
													<i>E. coli</i> results are compiled, water-quality conditions may have already changed. By contrast, it takes less
													than an hour to estimate recreational water quality using the predictive model and transmit results through
													the nowcasting system.</p>

											<br />
											<h4>How does the nowcast work?</h4>

											<b>The nowcast is a mathematical system that uses easily measured environmental and water-quality &#8220;variables,&#8221;
												such as turbidity and rainfall, to estimate levels of
												<i>E. coli</i>. Mathematical models are developed from several years of measurements taken at a particular site,
												and all models used in the Ohio Nowcast are swimming area or site specific.</b>
											<p>
												<img class='hidden-xs' border="0" style="padding:4px; border: 1px #0C4D32 solid" src="images/nowcast_signs.jpg" width="500"
												 height="441" alt="Photo of two nowcast signs." align="right" hspace="10" vspace="10">
												<img class='visible-xs' border="0" style="padding:0px; border: 1px #0C4D32 solid" src="images/nowcast_signs_w265_h234.jpg"
												 width="265" height="234" alt="Photo of two nowcast signs." align="center" hspace="0" vspace="5">
												<p>
													The nowcast for Lake Erie swimming areas provides the probability (in percent) that the established Ohio standard for
													<i>E. coli</i> will be exceeded. (The single-sample bathing-water standard for
													<i>E. coli</i> is 235). So on any given morning, there could be from a 1- to 100- percent probability that the
													standard would be exceeded. How does one know when the probability presents too great a risk to go swimming?
													Would you go swimming if there was an 80-percent probability that the standard would be exceeded? What about
													a 25 percent chance? To help out, managers at swimming areas establish a site-specific
													<!--a href="nowcast_glossary.asp#Threshold probability"-->threshold probability
													<!--/a-->
													based on historical data.</p>
												<p>The nowcast for the Cuyahoga River at Jaite provides a predicted
													<i>E. coli</i>
													concentration. Daily information on whether the predicted concentration exceeds or does not exceed the Ohio standard for
													<i>E. coli</i> will be posted online. (The single-sample primary-contact standard for
													<i>E. coli</i> is 298 colony-forming units/100 milliliters). For the Cuyahoga River, the daily predicted
													<i>E. coli</i>
													concentration will be for information only. The park managers will not issue advisories based on these estimates.
												</p>
												<p>
													<a href="#topabout">Return to top</a>
												</p>
												<p>
													We can measure the nowcast variables each morning, enter them into a computer program, and obtain the probability of exceeding
													the bathing-water standard (Lake Erie) or the estimated
													<i>E. coli</i> concentration (Cuyahoga River). Because the nowcast assessments of recreational water quality are
													ready within an hour, they are better than the old methods that take 18 hours to complete. The nowcast results
													are also used to report swimming area monitoring sample results through the
													<a href="https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/BeachGuardPublic/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Ohio Department of Health&#8217;s beach monitoring program</a>.&nbsp;</p>
												<p>The nowcast for swimming area advisories, presented on this website, are estimates of the probability of
													<i>E. coli</i> exceeding safe levels in the waters at the swimming areas right now. Similarly, the nowcast for
													the Cuyahoga River is an estimate of the current
													<i>E. coli
													</i> concentration. Obviously, there is some uncertainty with a nowcast, just as there is uncertainty with a
													weather forecast; but past tests have shown that nowcasting does fairly well in determining whether the swimming
													area is safe for swimming.
												</p>

												<h4>Do predictions or advisories indicate if a swimming area is open or closed to the public?</h4>

												<p>Advisories are not an indication of whether a swimming area is open or closed to the public. That decision may
													or may not be related to water quality, often because factors beyond water quality &#8212; such as wave conditions,
													rip currents, debris, or other issues &#8212; also affect the actual status of a swimming area.

				As a part of the Great Lakes Beach Health Initiative, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), and other federal, state, and local
				agencies and universities have developed and implemented the use of predictive modeling at over 50 swimming areas across
				the Great Lakes to provide advisories for water-quality. Water quality (specifically, high levels of
				<i>E. coli</i> bacteria typically indicate fecal contamination of water) is an important topic at swimming locations along
				the Great Lakes, coastal regions and inland lakes. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development,
				National Exposure Research Laboratory (Athens, GA) provided the Virtual Beach software that is used extensively to develop
				predictive models. The models rely heavily on USGS research and national monitoring programs, and are considered essential
				to any swimming area management program working toward a real-time advisory systems. Please visit the publications linked
				below for more information.

				<h5>
					<b>Introduction</b>
				</h5>
				Swim advisories are issued by managers at swimming areas on the basis of standards for concentrations of bacterial indicators&#8212;
				<i>Escherichia coli</i> (
				<i>E. coli</i>) or enterococci for freshwaters and enterococci for marine waters. The analytical methods for these organisms,
				however, take at least 18&#8211;24 hours to complete. Recreational water-quality conditions may change during this time,
				leading to erroneous assessments of public-health risk. As a result, some agencies have turned to modeling to obtain
				near-real-time estimates of recreational water quality.
				<h5>
					<b>Statistical models</b>
				</h5>
				Techniques such as multiple linear regression (MLR) are used to develop multivariable statistical models on the basis of
				relations between fecal-indicator bacteria concentrations and variables known or suspected to affect their concentrations
				in a particular water body. The sources of fecal contamination do not need to be identified in order to develop and use
				statistical models. Multivariable statistical models (hereinafter &#8220;predictive models&#8221;) are being developed
				and tested in many areas of the USA. They are used for swimming area closure or advisory decisions at a few areas in
				the Great Lakes including the Ohio Nowcast.
				<h5>
					<b>Project partners</b>
				</h5>
				The Ohio Nowcast is the result of multi-year partnerships on several projects between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Ohio
				Water Science Center (OWSC), and other federal, state, and local agencies and universities. Current and past partners
				include Cleveland Metroparks, Cuyahoga County Board of Health (CCBH), Erie County Health Department, Lake County General
				Health District, Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (NEORSD), Ohio Department
				of Health (ODH), Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), Ohio Lake Erie Office, Ohio Water Development Authority,
				University of Toledo, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the U.S. National Park Service.

						<h5>
							<b>History of statistical modeling in Ohio</b>
						</h5>
						In Ohio, the use of predictive models was first explored with one year data at three Lake Erie swimming areas (
						<a href="https://oh.water.usgs.gov/reports/Abstracts/wrir.98-4241.html"
						 target="_blank">Francy and Darner, 1998</a>). This effort was expanded to include three additional Lake Erie swimming areas, one inland
						lake, and two seasons of data collection (
						<a href="https://oh.water.usgs.gov/reports/Abstracts/wrir02-4285.html" target="_blank">Francy and others, 2002</a>). Predictive models were subsequently developed for five Ohio Lake Erie swimming areas
						with 2-4 years of data, depending on the swimming area (
						<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2006/5192/" target="_blank">Francy and others, 2006</a>). The best model for each swimming area was based on a unique combination of variables
						that explained changes in
						<i>E. coli</i> concentrations. The &#8220;variables&#8221; included turbidity (water clarity), rainfall, wave height,
						water temperature, day of the year, and lake level. The model from Huntington (Bay Village) was validated using data
						collected during a independent year, leading to implementation of the Ohio Nowcast for Huntington in 2006. At the same
						time, a rapid analytical method was tested at river sites within the Cuyahoga Valley National Park (Brecksville, Oh)
						<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1210/" target="_blank">(Brady, 2007)</a> and later, models with turbidity as an explanatory variable were developed
						<a href="https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/usgspubs/sir/sir20095192" target="_blank">(Brady and others 2009)
						</a>. Continuing the work in Lake Erie, data were collected during the recreational season of 2007 to test and refine
						predictive models at Huntington, Edgewater (Cleveland), and Villa Angela (Cleveland) (
						<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2007/1427"
						 target="_blank">Francy and Darner, 2007</a>). The Huntington and Edgewater models performed well, and Edgewater was added to the Ohio
						Nowcast in 2008. Data were collected during 2008 to operate the nowcast at Huntington and Edgewater and monitor the
						performance of the models
						<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2009/1066/" target="_blank">(Francy and others, 2009)</a>. In 2011, Maumee Bay State Park was added and in 2012, Villa Angela was added to the
						Ohio Nowcast.</p>

					The USGS has been working with local agencies to test and develop predictive models at other Lake Erie swimming areas and
					at some Ohio inland lake swimming areas. During 2014, Nickel Plate (Huron, Oh), Vermillion Main Street Beach (Vermillion,
					Oh), Mentor Headlands State Park (Mentor, Oh), Fairport Harbor Lakefront Park Beach (Fairport Harbor, Oh) will be added
					to the Ohio Nowcast. We will continue to test models at Lakeview (Lorain, Oh), Lakefront Park (Huron, Oh), Tappan Lake
					(Deersville), and Seneca Lake (Senecaville).

					<h5>
						<b>Methods</b>
					</h5>
					The steps to develop statistical models are data collection; exploratory data analysis; model development, selection, and
					diagnosis; determination of model output values; and model validation and refinement. These steps are described in detail
					with examples in
					<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/2006/tm6b5" target="_blank">Francy and Darner (2006)</a>. Predictive modeling is a dynamic process; that is, models should be continuously validated
					and refined to improve predictions and better protect public health.</p>
				Tools to compile data and develop predictive models are available on-line through a
				<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/" target="_blank">USGS report</a>. These tools include software for creating predictive models (Virtual Beach) developed by U.S. Environmental
				Protection Agency; software to process weather data from the nearest National Weather Service airport site (PROCESSNOAA);
				and a spreadsheet to process lake-level data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Also in
				the report are results from a study where the USGS worked with 23 local and state agencies to improve existing operational
				nowcast systems at 4 swimming areas and expand the use of predictive models in nowcasts at an additional 45 swimming
				areas throughout the Great Lakes. The predictive models were specific to each swimming area, and the best model for each
				swimming area was based on a unique combination of environmental and water-quality variables. During validation of 42
				swimming areas models in 2012, the models overall performed better than the current method to assess recreational water
				quality (previous day&#8217;s
				<i>E. coli</i> concentration).</p>

					<b>What is
						<i>E. coli</i>?</b>
				</span>
				<br>
				<i>Escherichia coli</i> (
				<i>E. coli</i>) is one type of bacteria that is commonly found in the intestinal tracts of humans and other warm-blooded
				animals; it is therefore used as an indicator of fecal contamination of water. Most strains of
				<i>E. coli</i> are harmless; however, its presence may indicate that pathogens (disease-causing organisms) also are present
				in the water.
				<p>
					<p>
						<span style="font-size:139%;">
							<b>What are pathogens, and why is
								<i>E. coli</i> used to indicate their presence in water?</b>
						</span>
						<br> The
						<i>E. coli</i> bacterium, which is present in the feces of warm-blooded animals, is commonly associated with and is an
						indicator of several different disease-causing organisms, called pathogens. &nbsp;
						<ul>
							<li>
								<!--&#8226;-->Viral pathogens are believed to be the major cause of swimming-associated diseases (Natural Resources Defense Council,
								1998). There are more than 100 types of human pathogenic viruses that may be present in fecal-contaminated waters.
								<br> &nbsp;
							</li>
							<li>
								<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria are true living cells and are larger than viruses. Waterborne bacterial pathogens in the United States include
								species in the genera
								<i>Salmonella</i>,
								<i>Shigella</i>,
								<i>Vibrio</i>,
								<i>Campylobacter</i>, and rare strains of
								<i>E. coli</i>.
								<br> &nbsp;
							</li>
							<li>
								<!--&#8226;-->Protozoa are one-celled animals. The principal protozoan pathogens that are waterborne are
								<i>Giardia lamblia</i> and
								<i>Cryptosporidium parvum</i>.
							</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Because of its association with pathogens and because it is comparatively easy to grow in the laboratory,
							<i>E. coli</i> is the basis for Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York recreational water-quality standards. There are several
							varieties of pathogenic
							<i>E. coli</i> and hundreds of varieties of harmless
							<i>E. coli</i>. One variety of
							<i>E. coli</i> that is pathogenic has been associated with undercooked ground beef.
						</p>

						</p>
						<p>
							<span style="font-size:139%;">
								<b>How are
									<i>E. coli</i> levels measured?</b>
							</span>
							<br> Daily water samples are collected from the swimming area each morning in sterile bottles. The samples are brought
							to the laboratory where they are processed for
							<i>E. coli</i> within 6 hours of collection. The method used to determine levels of
							<i>E. coli</i> is called membrane filtration. During membrane filtration, a measured amount of water is poured through
							a filter to trap bacteria onto the filter. The filter is placed on an agar plate and allowed to incubate at a warm
							temperature overnight. Colonies are counted the next day and recorded as colonies per 100 milliliters. A milliliter
							is a very small quantity of water&#8212;about 0.03 fluid ounces or one-fifth of a teaspoon.
							<p>
								<span style="font-size:139%;">
									<b>What is a water quality advisory?</b>
								</span>
								<br> A Water Quality Advisory is a public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted at the swimming area,
								to advise the public that current water quality standards are not acceptable for swimming due to elevated bacteria
								levels. A Water Quality Advisory remains in effect until another measurement is made that shows that
								<i>E. coli</i> levels are within acceptable limits.
								<p>
									<span style="font-size:139%;">
										<b>How do managers at swimming areas determine when to issue a water quality advisory?</b>
									</span>
									<br> There are state standards for
									<i>E. coli</i> in recreational waters. The state standards are based on those recommended by USEPA and determined by
									earlier USEPA studies. In USEPA studies, investigators determined that when
									<i>E. coli</i> levels went up, the number of swimming-associated gastrointestinal illnesses also increased. The Ohio,
									Pennsylvania and New York bathing-water standard for E. coli is a single-sample value of 235 colonies per 100 milliliters.
									If the count for
									<i>E. coli</i> is equal to or above 235, the manager will issue a water-quality advisory.
									<p>
										<span style="font-size:139%;">
											<b>What are the problems with the current method used for issuing advisories (based on the previous day&#8217;s
												<i>E. coli</i> level)?</b>
										</span>
										<br> Current methods to assess concentrations of
										<i>E. coli</i> using membrane filtration or other cultural methods take at least 18 hours to complete. During this
										period,
										<i>E. coli</i> levels may increase or decrease substantially. A heavy rainfall may cause an increase in
										<i>E. coli</i> levels overnight. Alternatively, a bright sunny day may cause
										<i>E. coli</i> levels to fall. So, the swimming area may be erroneously posted based on measured
										<i>E. coli</i> levels from the previous day.
									</p>
									<p>
										<a href="#topfaq">Return to top</a>
									</p>
									<p>
										<span style="font-size:139%;">
											<b>What is being done to improve the accuracy of the advisory system?</b>
										</span>
										<br> Scientists are developing and testing tools that can provide managers at swimming areas with quick, reliable indicators
										of recreational water-quality conditions. Predictive models are one means to provide these rapid assessments. Predictive
										models use easily and quickly measured water-quality surrogates, such as rainfall and wave height, to estimate
										levels of
										<i>E. coli</i> or the probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded.
										<p>
											<span style="font-size:139%;">
												<b>Is the water safe for swimming?</b>
											</span>
											<br> The water at a swimming area may appear to be clear and clean, but it doesn&#8217;t mean it is safe for swimming.
											Bacteria cannot be seen in the water; it is therefore important to remember the following guidelines: &nbsp;
											<ul>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels are typically elevated for 24 to 48 hours after heavy rains as the result of surface runoff.
													<br> &nbsp;
												</li>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Bacteria levels may also be elevated when wind velocities and waves are high. These conditions can stir up the
													bottom sediment in the lake and cause the water to appear turbid, or dirty.
													<br> &nbsp;
												</li>
												<li>
													<!--&#8226;-->Water-quality signs are posted at the swimming areas. Look for the signs and read the signs to determine whether
													or not the water is safe. Water quality advisories are issued when water-quality standards are not within safe
													limits. Swimming in the water under these conditions may result in illness.
												</li>
											</ul>
											<p>
												<span style="font-size:139%;">
													<b>What illnesses may result from swimming in the water?</b>
												</span>
												<br> There is a potential for illness to occur when bacteria levels are unsafe. Gastrointestinal upset, including
												nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea may occur as a result of swallowing contaminated water. There
												is also a potential for developing upper respiratory infections, in addition to ear and eye infections. Skin
												infections may also occur if an exposed wound is in contact with contaminated water.
												<p>
													<span style="font-size:139%;">
														<b>Who is most at risk for becoming ill?</b>
													</span>
													<br> Children, the elderly, and individuals with weakened immune systems are most at risk for developing illnesses
													from swimming when bacteria levels are unsafe.
													<p>
														<span style="font-size:139%;">
															<b>What should I do if I became ill after swimming at a swimming area?</b>
														</span>
														<br> If you should become ill, or suspect you became ill, after swimming at a swimming area, you should notify
														your doctor and your local health department. Your local health department is interested in tracking illnesses
														that may have resulted from water-contact activities and will conduct follow-up investigations where necessary.

													<p>
														<a href="#topfaq">Return to top</a>
													</p>
													<p>
														<span style="font-size:139%;">
															<b>Where does pollution at swimming areas come from?</b>
														</span>
														<br> Pollution in water at swimming areas can be attributed to several factors, the most common of which are sanitary
														and storm-sewer overflows. In older, urban areas, sanitary and storm-sewer systems were often combined and
														designed to overflow during heavy rains to prevent basement flooding. It is therefore important not to swim
														near storm drains or other discharge pipes.
														<p>
															Other sources of pollution include sewage-treatment-plant overflows, runoff from lawns and streets, animal wastes (especially
															waterfowl wastes), malfunctioning home and commercial sewage systems, and boating wastes.
															<p>
																<p>
																	<span style="font-size:139%;">
																		<b>How can I help keep the swimming area clean?</b>
																	</span>
																	<br> Everyone has a role in keeping the swimming areas clean, safe, and enjoyable places to visit. The following
																	practices will help to maintain one of our greatest natural resources&#8212;fresh water lakes. &nbsp;
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Follow good personal hygiene practices, such as using public restrooms and properly disposing of diapers.
																			Also, don&#8217;t swim if you have diarrhea.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Properly dispose of pet wastes and garbage.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->If you are a boater, comply with rules pertaining to the proper pumping of sewage holding tanks.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Maintain home sewage systems in good working order to prevent the discharge of improperly treated sewage.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Minimize the use of lawn chemicals, pesticides, and other toxic household products.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Conserve water.
																			<br> &nbsp;
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<!--&#8226;-->Report any evidence of swimming area pollution to your local health department.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		<span style="font-size:139%;">
																			<b>Is there a &#8220;pathogen problem&#8221; at swimming areas? Are people getting sick?</b>
																		</span>
																		<br> There is no true measure of the magnitude of disease associated with recreational water exposures (USEPA,
																		1999), in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York or elsewhere. That is because when people get sick after a weekend
																		at the swimming area, the cause of illness is unknown. In addition, the illness is not reported unless
																		there was an outbreak among a specific population, like a group of athletes participating in a triathlon.
																		<p>
																			Swimming in polluted water can make you sick (Natural Resources Defense Council, 1998). Epidemiological studies in the United
																			States have consistently found an association between gastrointestinal illness and exposure to contaminated
																			recreational waters; the potential for other types of infections is not completely understood (USEPA,
																			1999).

																			<span style="font-size:139%;">
																				<b>How would use of the nowcasting system and predictive models differ from the current way of assessing
																					swimming safety?</b>
																			</span>
																			<br> Current methods to assess recreational water quality rely on collecting a sample of water from the swimming
																			area, transporting it to a laboratory, and determining numbers of indicator organisms, such as
																			<i>E. coli</i>. It takes as least 18 hours to grow
																			<i>E. coli</i> in the laboratory. Therefore, by the time
																			<i>E. coli</i> results are compiled, swimming area water-quality conditions may have already changed. By
																			contrast, it takes less than an hour to estimate recreational water quality using the predictive model
																			and transmit results through the nowcasting system.
																			<p>
																				<span style="font-size:139%;">
																					<b>How well do the predictive models work?</b>
																				</span>
																				<br> The nowcast has been operating in Ohio at Huntington since 2006, at Edgewater since 2008, at Maumee
																				Bay State Park since 2011, and at Villa Angela since 2012. Performances of the models in the nowcast
																				were monitored for those years. If one were to examine the data in hindsight and assume the culture results
																				for
																				<i>E. coli</i> were the correct results, we can compare the performance of predictive models to that of
																				using the previous day&#8217;s
																				<i>E. coli</i> concentration to predict the current day&#8217;s
																				<i>E. coli</i> concentration, the later being the old method used by many managers at swimming areas. Overall,
																				the nowcast provided more correct responses than the previous day&#8217;s
																				<i>E. coli</i> concentration at the four Ohio nowcast swimming areas.
																				<p>
																					<span style="font-size:139%;">
																						<b>Why was the USGS involved in this research?</b>
																					</span>
																					<br> Water quality and quantity are critical topics in which the USGS has developed expertise over many
																					years. The relatively recent addition of biological science to the agency&#8217;s core program creates
																					opportunities to apply science in a variety of new ways.
																					<p>
																						The USGS did not do this research alone. Agencies that cooperated with us on data collection and model development or provided
																						funding were the Ohio Water Development Authority, Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District, Cuyahoga
																						County Board of Health, the Ohio Lake Erie Office, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the University
																						of Toledo, Erie County Health Department, Muskingum Watershed Conservancy District, and Lake County
																						General Health District.
																						<p>
																							<span style="font-size:139%;">
																								<b>Are models being developed for other swimming areas?</b>
																							</span>
																							<br> Yes, models are being developed by research institutions and public agencies for other coastal and
																							inland swimming areas in the United States.
																							<p>
																								As part of a Great Lakes Beach Health initiative, a USGS Midwest area team worked with local agencies to develop and implement
																								the use of predictive models at
																								<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2013/5166/"
																								 target="_blank">49 swimming areas across the Great Lakes</a>.
																								<p>
																									Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York continue to work with agencies to develop and implement the use of predictive models along
																									the shores of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario and at inland recreation swimming areas.
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									<a href="#topfaq">Return to top</a>
																								</p>
																								<p>
																									<span style="font-size:139%;">
																										<b>Is anyone else doing the same kind of research? Are other predictive models being used at swimming
																											areas?</b>
																									</span>
																									<br> Yes, the USGS and other researchers are working on developing and testing predictive models at
																									coastal swimming areas. Operational models (those used daily to issue swim advisories or closings)
																									that rely on several explanatory variables (rainfall, wave height, wind direction, etc.) are being
																									used in other communities in the United States, mainly in the Great Lakes. These include swimming
																									areas in
																									<a href="https://www.wibeaches.us/apex/f?p=BEACH:HOME:2771212174982467" target="_blank">Wisconsin</a> and in
																									<a href="https://www.cpdbeaches.com/pages/home-map/" target="_blank">Chicago, Illinois</a>. The USGS Georgia Water Science Center has initiated a bacteria alert program
																									for a recreational river that provides the same type of output as the Lake Erie models&#8212;the
																									probability that the standard will be exceeded (Lawrence, 2005).
																									<p>
																										<span style="font-size:139%;">
																											<b>Is it acceptable to use a model to assess recreational water quality?</b>
																										</span>
																										<br> USEPA states that a monitoring program is essential to any swimming area management program and
																										recommends that the current
																										<i>E. coli</i> laboratory method be used for assessing ambient waters and for making decisions concerning
																										the protection of human health (USEPA 2002, p. 4-17). However, USEPA also states that modeling
																										tools may be used to supplement, not replace, monitoring. Modeling tools can provide conservative
																										estimates when there is a lag time between sampling the water quality and obtaining results. If
																										models are properly developed and applied, they can be used in making advisory or closing decisions
																										at swimming areas (USEPA 2002, p. 4-22).

								<b>Combined sewer</b>. A sewer that carries both sanitary (sewage) and storm water in the same pipe, often in older,
								urban areas.
								<p>
									<b>Combined sewer overflow (CSO)</b>. An event that takes place, often with the aid of a control device, that allows
									for a combined sewer to overflow into area waterways in order to prevent flooding. A CSO event is most likely to

									<p>
										<b>
											<a name="ecoli"></a>
											<i id="ecoli">Escherichia coli</i> (
											<i>E. coli</i>)</b>. A rod shaped, gram-negative bacterium, commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract and feces
										of warm-blooded animals. It is one species within the fecal-coliform group of bacteria and is distinguished from
										other fecal coliforms by biochemical tests. Although most strains of
										<i>E. coli</i> are harmless, some strains cause illness.
										<i>E. coli</i> is an &#8220;indicator&#8221; of fecal contamination and the possible presence of disease-causing organisms.
										<i>E. coli</i> is the preferred indicator for freshwater recreational waters.
										<p>
											<b>Explanatory variable</b>. A quantity of something that varies and can be used to explain increases and decreases
											in another variable. Explanatory variables for recreational waters include rainfall, wave height, and turbidity,
											and are used to explain increases and decreases in
											<i>E. coli</i> concentrations.
											<p>
												<b>Fecal coliforms</b>. A group of bacteria that were used in past to establish standards for fecal contamination
												in recreational waters. Fecal coliforms are still used to establish standards for shellfish-harvesting waters
												and for some permitting applications. Although they are used to assess fecal contamination of water, some fecal
												coliforms actually come from nonfecal sources. Fecal coliforms are defined by the methodology used for detection
												(lactose fermentation at 44.5°C).
												<p>
													<b>
														<a name="Foreshore head"></a>Foreshore head</b>. Water level data from a piezometer (shallow ground-water well) installed 20 ft inland
													from the edge of water. The foreshore head measured in this manner can best be characterized as a combination
													of the pressure changes due to the local water table, fluctuations in barometric pressure, the water level in
													the lake, and the pressure variance due to wave action

												<p>
													<b>Indicator bacteria</b>. A type or group of bacteria that indicate the possible presence of disease causing (pathogenic)
													microorganisms. Indicator bacteria are not usually pathogenic themselves, but they are often associated with
													pathogens because they are present in large quantities in the feces of warm-blooded animals.
													<p>
														<b>Membrane filtration</b>. A technique used for the detection and enumeration of bacteria from water. This method
														provides a direct count of bacteria based on the growth of colonies on the surface of a membrane filter through
														which sample was passed. To assess the sanitary quality of water using bacterial indicators such as
														<i>E. coli</i>, the number is expressed as colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL).
														<p>
															<b>Milliliter</b>. A milliliter is a metric unit of volume equivalent to one-millionth of a cubic meter. 100
															milliliters is equivalent to about 3.5 fluid ounces or slightly less than ½ cup.
															<p>
																<b>Multiple linear regression (MLR)</b>. A standard statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables
																to predict the outcome of another variable (response variable). The goal of MLR is to select a group of explanatory
																variables that explain as much as possible of the variation observed in the response variable, leaving as
																little variation as possible to unexplained &#8220;noise.&#8221; In the case of predictive models for swimming
																areas, rainfall and wave height are examples of explanatory variables and
																<i>E. coli</i> is the response variable.
																<p>
																	<b>Nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU)</b>. A unit of measure for the turbidity (cloudiness) of water.
																	<p>
																		<b>Nowcasting</b>. A &#8220;nowcast&#8221; of recreational water quality is similar to a weather forecast
																		except it provides an estimate of current conditions instead of future conditions. A nowcast gives the
																		probability that the bathing-water standard will be exceeded and swimming would result in an excessive
																		health risk.
																		<p>
																			<b>Pathogen</b>. An organism that causes disease.
																			<p>
																				<b>
																					<a name="PAR"></a>Photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR)</b>. Radiation in the 400-700 nanometer range measured
																				by use of sensor at the swimming area. PAR from the previous day is negatively related to the concentration
																				of
																				<i>E. coli</i> in water at some swimming areas.
																			</p>
																			<p>
																				<a href="#topglossary">Return to top</a>
																			</p>
																			<p>
																				<b>
																					<a name="Predictive models"></a>Predictive models</b>. Mathematical models that use easily measured environmental and water-quality
																				variables (&#8220;explanatory variables&#8221;), such as wave height and rainfall, to estimate the
																				<i>E. coli</i> concentration or the probability of exceeding the bathing-water standard of 235 col/100 mL
																				<i>E. coli</i>.
																				<p>
																					<b>
																						<a name="Primary-contact waters"></a>Primary-contact waters</b> are suitable for full-body contact such as swimming, canoeing, and scuba
																					diving.
																					<p>
																						<b>
																							<a name="qPCR"></a>qPCR</b>. Quantitative polymerase-chain reaction. qPCR is a rapid analytical method that can be
																						performed in about 2 hours. It is a molecular method that targets the DNA of a specific organism &#8211;
																						for recreational water-quality, qPCR methods were designed to target genes specific for
																						<i>E. coli</i> or enterococci.
																						<p>
																							<b>Recreational water-quality standards</b>. Standards established by the state and based on recommendations
																							and epidemiological studies from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, they are used to decide
																							when to issue a water-quality advisory. In Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York, the single-sample bathing-water
																							standard for
																							<i>E. coli</i> is 235 colonies per 100 milliliters (col/100 mL). This means that when the
																							<i>E. coli</i> concentration is equal to or greater than 235 col/100 mL, swimming in the water would
																							pose a high risk of illness.
																							<p>
																								<b>Sanitary sewer overflow (SSO)</b>. An event that takes place in which sewage from a sanitary sewer
																								system overflows, or spills, often from a sanitary manhole. A SSO can occur if a blockage is present
																								within a sanitary sewer system and/or there is too much flow.
																								<p>
																									<b>
																										<a name="Threshold probability"></a>Threshold probability</b>. To decided whether or not there&#8217;s too great a risk to go swimming
																									on any particular day, managers at swimming areas establish a site-specific threshold probability
																									based on historical data. Probabilities equal to or above the threshold would indicate to the swimming
																									area manager that
																									<i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely above the standard, and an advisory would be issued.
																									Probabilities below the threshold indicate that
																									<i>E. coli</i> concentrations are most likely below the standard.
																									<p>
																										<b>Turbidity</b>. A quantitative value for the clarity of water sample&#8212;the higher the turbidity
																										the more cloudy the water. Turbidity is measured with a turbidimeter, which measures the scattering
																										effect that suspended particles have on light.
																										<p>
																											<b>Virus</b>. A submicroscopic particle (are too small to be seen by regular light microscopes) that
																											is only able to replicate by taking over the machinery of a living cell. Many viruses cause disease.
																											<p>
																												<b>Water quality</b>. A term used to describe the chemical, physical, and biological characteristics
																												of water, usually in respect to its suitability for a particular purpose.
																												<p>
																													<b>
																														<a name="Water-quality advisory"></a>Water-quality advisory</b>. A public notification, typically in the form of a sign posted
																													at the swimming area and (or) on the Internet, to advise the public that current recreational
																													water-quality standards are not acceptable for swimming because of elevated
																													<i>E. coli</i> levels.

			<h4>Partners
				<a name="toppartners"></a>
			</h4>
			<p>The Ohio Nowcast is the result of multi-year partnerships on several projects between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
				Ohio Water Science Center, and other federal, state, and local agencies and universities.
				<br>
				<br> Monitoring and water-quality information are updated 4-7 days/week on the Ohio Nowcast by Cuyahoga County Board of Health
				(Huntington), Northeast Ohio Regional Sewer District (Edgewater), the University of Toledo (Maumee Bay State Park), Erie
				County Health Department (Nickel Plate and Vermillion), Lake County General Health District (Mentor Headlands and Fairport
				Harbor), and the U.S. National Park Service (Cuyahoga River). Other partners on the nowcast include Cleveland Metroparks,
				Ohio Department of Natural Resources (ODNR), and Ohio Department of Health (ODH). Current activities are supported by
				the U.S. EPA Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, the USGS Oceans Research Priority Plan, the U.S. EPA BEACHES grant program
				(administered by Ohio Department of Health), and funding and (or) in-kind services from partnering agencies.
				<br>
				<br>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, National Exposure Research Laboratory (Athens,
				GA) provided the &#8220;Virtual Beach&#8221; software that is used extensively to develop predictive models.
				<br>
				<br> Past funding for research and development supporting the Ohio Nowcast was provided by Ohio Water Development Authority,
				U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Advanced Monitoring Initiative, the Ohio Lake Erie Office, and the USGS Cooperative
				Water Program.
